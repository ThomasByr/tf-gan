## ‚úèÔ∏è Setup

You first need to build and compile the source code for your system (please replace `x` with the specific version numbers) :

```ps1
pip uninstall tf_gan -y
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install .\dist\tf_gan-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

Then import the library as follow :

```py
import tf_gan as tfg
```

This hole program is supposed to run on `python>=3.10.4`.

## üíÅ More infos

> Tensorflow `>=2` is compatible with NVidia GPUs and requires _almost_ no change in the code base (_not required_)

[This](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) is the page you are looking for. TL;DR :

- [450.80.02](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) minimum graphics drivers
- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (please refer to [this guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html#install-windows))

Then setup `PATH` variables, were `x` is the minor of the CUDA toolkit you have installed (make sure the paths are correct) :

```ps1
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.x\bin;%PATH%
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.x\extras\CUPTI\lib64;%PATH%
SET PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.x\include;%PATH%
SET PATH=C:\tools\cuda\bin;%PATH%
```

Also make sure the [compute capability](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capabilities) of the GPU isn't slowing down the hole process due to the (non)atomicity of some operations. Furthermore, using GPU isn't going to be particularly helpfull with a small number of features to train. Benefits will increase as the number of features to train goes [past 4000](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55749899/training-a-simple-model-in-tensorflow-gpu-slower-than-cpu) or so.

## üß™ Testing

To begin, please make sure you have the necessary library up and ready on your environment :

```ps1
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

Then run a batch of tests with `unittest` with :

```ps1
python setup.py test
```

In addition, you can find code examples in the [examples folder](tf_gan/examples/) :

1. Add the examples directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable with

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=${TFGAN_REPO}/tf_gan/examples:${PYTHONPATH}
   ```

   Be sure to use the location where you cloned this repository.

2. Add this repository to your PYTHONPATH environment variable so that it can
   be used for `tf_gan` instead of any older libraries you might have
   installed.

   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=${TFGAN_REPO}:${PYTHONPATH}
   ```

3. Then navigate to the examples folder and run the training script.

   ```ps1
   cd tf_gan/examples/
   python ./${EXAMPLE_NAME}/train.py
   ```
